# Customer-Retirement--Prediction


![fb](images/fb9.png)


# Background

You work as a data scientist at a major bank in NYC and you have been tasked to develop a model that can predict whether a customer is able to retire or not based on his/her features. Features are his/her age and net 401K savings (retirement savings in the U.S.). You though that Support Vector Machines can be a great candidate to solve the problem.

ploting the boundary using the trained classifier
* Run the classifier to predict the outcome on all pixels with resolution of 0.01
* Colouring the pixels with 0 or 1
* If classified as 0 it will be magenta, and if it is classified as 1 it will be shown in blue
